Prerequisites:
    You must have node.js installed on your computer. If you do not, please visit https://nodejs.org/en/
  and follow their instructions for installation.
    When the program is pulled from the repository, the gitignore does not allow the transfer of the node
  modules needed to run the application. For first time use only, please run from the command line
      npm install
	  npm install use-image
  while in the logically-app directory. This will add the needed node modules into the directory to begin
  using the software. 

To Run:
  From the command line, make sure you are in the logically-app directory. Once you are there, simply type:
    npm start
  and the program will begin running. A new browser window will appear, and you will be able to interact with
  the webpage

To exit the program, simply hit ctrl c in the terminal

Please note:
  This is still in it's very early development stages. The current product is far from what the final will be.
