to server:
{
    "inputs" : [true,false,false],
    "gates" : ["or","and"],
    "connections" : [["input0","gate0"],["input1","gate0"],["input2","gate1"],["gate0","gate1"],["gate1","output"]]
}

server returns:
{
	"outputs" : [true/false]
}

NOTES:
	-"gates", "connections", and "inputs" are arrays of however many of each there are.
	-"gates" and "inputs" array should be in order, for example: the "input0" in "connections" refers to "inputs"[0] in the array
	-it returns an array of outputs
