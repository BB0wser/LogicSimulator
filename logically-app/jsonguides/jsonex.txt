to server:
{
	"or" : ["gate0"],
	"and" : ["gate1"],
    "inputs" : [true,false,false],
    "connections" : [["input0","gate0"],["input1","gate0"],["input2","gate1"],["gate0","gate1"],["gate1","output"]]
}

server returns:
{
	"outputs" : [true/false]
}

NOTES:
	-each gate that exists gets its own key, containing an array of each that exists in the circuit
	-"connections", and "inputs" are arrays of however many of each there are.
	-"gates" and "inputs" array should be in order, for example: the "input0" in "connections" refers to "inputs"[0] in the array
	-it returns an array of outputs
