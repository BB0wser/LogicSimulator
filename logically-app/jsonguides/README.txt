These are to show what needs to be sent to the server by the front end, and what the server will send back.

The top json string shows the minimum data required to be sent to the server. Note that having other
data in the file when its sent to the server (such as data thats used for parts of the server)
is fine and will not affect anything.

Under that will show what the server returns back.

Below that may or may not be various notes

------------LET ME (Teagan) KNOW IF ITS TOO DIFFICULT/INEFFICIENT TO BUILD YOUR JSON OBJECTS THIS WAY SO I CAN WORK WITH YOU TO MAKE IT WORK FOR BOTH ENDS

NOTES (just to be safe):
	-The strings on the left side of the colons must be exactly the same as shown in the example
	
the different paths:
	"localhost:5000" + :
	"/"
	"/jsonex"
	"/save"
	"/load"
