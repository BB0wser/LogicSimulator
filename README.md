# LogicSimulator

Generic Team's Logic Simulator for CMSC461

To run the front end you have to be in LogicSimulator/logically-app and run
-npm install
-npm start

To run the backend you have to be in LogicSimulator/logically-app as well and run
-yarn start-python

To run the backend, you may have to install additional dependencies:
	flask
	flask_cors
If you do not have these two installed, they can be installed using the commands:
	pip3 install flask
	pip3 install flask_cors

This is to run them together. You can also run the backend server by itself. The instructions for that are found in its servclientinfo.txt
