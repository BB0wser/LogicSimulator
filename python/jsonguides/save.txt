to server:
	send entire constructed json object for that circuit, plus add to the file the name to save the file as:
	{
		"value" : "nameoffile.json"
	}

server returns:
	the string:
	"save successful" 
		or
	"save failed"

	
Notes:
	-note that the server returns a string, not a json object
	-to check for the saved file, go to saves/ directory
