Breif instructions for server/client
-to run server
	python3 serv.py

-server runs on "localhost:5000/"
-paths: "localhost:5000/" + :
	"" - works with GET, POST, and OPTIONS, will return string to show server is working
	"circuit" - (POST only) recieves json containing circuit data, processes it, and returns output of circuit in json format. Example: {"output" : true}
	"save" - (POST only) recieves json, saves it to file to load later, returns string denoting success or failure of saving file
	"load" - (POST only) recieves string containing filename to load, returns json data in file, or returns {"ERROR" : "error string"} json if couldnt load
	"truth" - (POST only) receives json object in the same format as "circuit" path, returns a "truth_table" json object with an array of the inputs, and an array of outputs
	
-you can test the server by sending post request via Postman or with "client.py"
-post requests must be sent in format shown in the format in jsonguides/ directory, also there are example json files in this dierectory for reference


-to run "client.py"
	python3 client.py <file.json> <path>

-client sends json file to "localhost:5000/" + <path> given above
-the path is just the extension, not the whole thing. for example:	"python3 client.py example.json circuit" sends example.json to the /circuit path in the server
-the client sends the json file to the server and prints out the response
-<file.json> must be in the appropriate format, look at/use any of the "example*.json" files, or go to jsonguides/ to see how to make them
-cannot send to "/" path using client.py
